# Repo Author Inspect

A simple CLI tool to view issues, PRs, and discussions by an author on a repo.

## Requirements

You'll need a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `read:discussion` permission. See the docs on this [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

You'll then need to set this token to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. You can do this by putting `GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>` before running each command, or doing `export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>` to store it as an environment variable. 

**Install**

```
pip install git+https://github.com/pmbaumgartner/gh-author-inspect
```

## Usage

Run the command `gh-author-inspect <repo> <username>`, e.g.:

```bash
gh-author-inspect explosion/spacy pmbaumgartner
```

```
